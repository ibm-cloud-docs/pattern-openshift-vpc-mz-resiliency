[Note: Depending on the type of workloads, the disaggregated architecture may be suitable.]                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4           | Logs Storage  (Audit, Operational)  | -Provide highly available storage for logs                                                                                                        | -VPC Block storage  - Cloud Object storage (COS)                                                      | VPC Block storage                                                      | Built-in Red Hat OpenShift monitoring tools are used and can be installed using the cluster logging operator. The cluster logging instance needs an IBM Cloud Block Storage class.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Cloud Object Storage can be cross-region for data backups to enable recovery in the event of a region outage.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6           | Portworx key-value database (KVDB)  | Provide a KVDB solution for Portworx to store the cluster's state, configuration data, and metadata associated with storage volumes and snapshots. | -Internal KVDB for Portworx - IBM Cloud Database for etcd - Other external KVDB                        | Internal KVDB for Portworx                                             | Portworx recommends using the built-in internal KVDB for your Portworx cluster except when configuring a synchronous DR setup, for example. For setting up external KVDB, see [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_portworx_kv_store\#portworx-kv-db](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_portworx_kv_store#portworx-kv-db).  |
