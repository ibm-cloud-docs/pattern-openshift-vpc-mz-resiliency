Include a short description, summary, or overview in a single paragraph that follows the title.

After the introduction, include a summary of the typical use case for the architecture. The use case might include the motivation for the architecture composition, business challenge, or target cloud environments.

## Design scope 
{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), pattern-name covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:


- **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual infrastructure

- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, Archive and Migration

- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing

- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response

- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability

- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

The Figure 3 shows the domains that are covered in this solution.

## Requirements 
{: #requirements}



The following represents a baseline set of requirements which we believe are applicable to most clients and critical to successful SAP deployment.

| Aspect | Requirement |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network| Enterprise connectivity to customer data center(s) to provide access to applications from on-prem|
| | Map and convert existing customer SAP Network functionality into IBM Cloud and VPC networking services|
| | Migrate/Redeploy customer IP addressing scheme within the IBM Cloud environment |
| | Provide network isolation with the ability to segregate applications based on attributes such as data classification, public vs internal apps and function  |
| Security | Provide data encryption in transit and at rest|
| | Migrate customer IDS/IAM Services to target IBM Cloud environment |
| | Retain the same firewall rulesets across existing DCs |
| | Firewalls must be restrictively configured to provide advanced security features and prevent all traffic, both inbound and outbound, except that which is specifically required, documented, and approved, and include IPS/IDS services |
| Resiliency | Multi-site capability to support a disaster recovery strategy and solution leveraging IBM Cloud infrastructure DR capabilities|
| | Provide backups for data retention|
| | RTO/RPO = 4 hours/15 minutes; Rollback to original environments should occur no later than specified RTOs |
| | 99.95 Availability|
| | Backups |
| | - Prod: Daily Full, logs per SAP product standard, 30 days retention time \n - Non-Prod: Weekly full, logs per SAP product standard, 14 days retention time|
| Service management | Provide Health and System Monitoring with ability to monitor and correlate performance metrics and events and provide alerting across applications and infrastructure |
| | Ability to diagnose issues and exceptions and identify error sources|
| | Automate management processes to keep applications and infrastructure secure, up to date, and available |
| Other| Migrate SAP workloads from existing data center to IBM Cloud VPC |
| | Customer's SAP systems and applications run on NetWeaver (application) & HANA (DB), AnyDB or S/4 HANA |
| | Provide an Image Replication migration solution that will minimize disruption during cut-over|
| | Cloud infrastructure for the proposed IAAS solution must be SAP Certified |
| | IBM Cloud IaaS will be deployed to support SAP and surrounding non-SAP workloads |
| | Customer does not want to adopt [RISE](https://www.ibm.com/consulting/rise-with-sap?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700077624079785&p5=e&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr9bRlt7LgQMVJdHCBB0cewwcEAAYASAAEgIVgfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) at this time but wants to consider Cloud deployment solution that would facilitate a future RISE transformation|

As mentioned earlier, the Architecture Framework is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for which architecture decisions need to be made. The following sections contain the considerations, and architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are in play in this solution pattern.
