# 1. Pattern Objectives

The objective of this pattern is to provide a resilient solution design for Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS) on a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture deployment, on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, that meets high availability requirements for enterprise workloads that require persistent storage. This pattern is intended to:

-   Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment architecture reference following the [IBM Architecture Design Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework).
-   Provide a prescriptive, end-2-end enterprise-class solution design, with diagrams, component architecture decisions along with rationale for cloud component selection to meet enterprise requirements.
-   Ensure requirements can be met from a performance, system availability and security perspective.

This document focuses on leveraging cloud platform capabilities to architect resilient ROKS on VPC. The pattern provides high availability and backup architecture within a single region for Red Hat OpenShift on VPC.

# 2. Pattern Overview

The Multi-Zone Resiliency Pattern for Red Hat OpenShift deploys containerized enterprise workloads that require persistent storage on VPC, using compute, storage, and network cloud resources as well as other Cloud Services provisioned across multiple availability zones within a single region .

The multi-zone Red Hat OpenShift cluster pattern provides 99.99% infrastructure availability. For high availability of stateful application, close coordination between application teams, infrastructure teams (including availability of storage), and database teams is essential to design highly available stateful applications on multi-zone Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

This pattern uses a multi-zone workload cluster configured with Portworx-Store to provide persistent storage for databases and other stateful application components and a Portworx-Backup cluster for application data backup and recovery.

Deploying Red Hat OpenShift cluster across three availability zones is the recommended option for a highly available cluster to be used for highly available stateful applications. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}-managed control plane nodes are automatically distributed across availability zones on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The network communication across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} availability zones has low enough latency to satisfy Red Hat OpenShift etcd and Portworx requirements. Portworx provides a robust data service platform for persistent storage with replication and high availability features across multiple availability zones to run stateful containerized applications. This pattern is not to be used across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions, which have much higher latency for region-to-region network communication.

The Multi-Zone Resiliency Pattern for Red Hat OpenShift can be used to support business continuity policies or regulatory requirements with country boundaries or geo data residence constraints. It does not support out-of-region disaster recovery. [See the **Cross-Region Resiliency Pattern** to address disaster recovery policies or business continuity policies with geo or distance compliance requirements.]

Following the [Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)\*, the Multi-Zone **Resiliency** Pattern for Red Hat OpenShift covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

-   **Compute:** Containers
-   **Storage:** Primary Storage, Backup Storage, SDS
-   **Networking:** Load Balancing
-   **Security:** Data Security
-   **Resiliency:** High Availability, Backup and Restore
-   **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting

# 4. Solution Architecture

-   Red Hat OpenShift is deployed on VPC Servers across three availability zones within a region.
-   Compatible/recommended nodes (that are currently available for Red Hat OpenShift on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} â€“ Virtual Servers Instances Shared) are used for worker nodes to run stateful application in production environment.   
    ![](image/545eb7ba85b9774f5a5a2b170ea6242a.png)Ref: IBM Cloud Docs
-   High performance Secondary storage (10 IOPS Block) is used and attached to worker nodes. Portworx Enterprise (an SDS â€“ Software Defined Storage) is setup in the cluster across three zones using a Converged architecture (compute and storage in same node). Built-in internal key-value database (KVDB) is used for Portworx cluster.
-   ![Portworx deployment architecture hyperconverged](image/0c1947f67fce0cfed4a32e2fb6107f7d.png)Ref: Portworx Docs
-   Any databases that may be required for the stateful applications use the Portworx SDS.
-   In the Red Hat OpenShift multizone cluster, the worker nodes in the worker pools are distributed across multiple zones within one region. Red Hat OpenShift multizone clusters are designed to *evenly* schedule pods across worker nodes and zones to ensure availability and recovery from failure. If worker nodes are not spread *evenly* across the zones or capacity is insufficient in one of the zones, the Red Hat OpenShift controller might fail to schedule all requested pods.
-   Application Load Balancer (ALB) for VPC with multi-zone support is used to route traffic to the containerized application.
-   Containerized stateful applications are deployed within the Workload cluster and VPC. Management tools, such as backup tools, are deployed in the Management cluster and VPC. A local Transit Gateway allows traffic between the management and workload VPCs.
-   Worker nodes in worker pools are placed in separate subnets within each availability zone.
-   Security groups and ACLs (Access Control Lists) are used as firewalls to limit access to worker node server for operational purposes and control network traffic.
-   All storage is encrypted at rest using storage encryption with customer-provided keys managed by Key Protect.
-   Data is encrypted in transit using TLS encryption. Portworx Backup is used to enable backup and recovery of containerized applications deployed in the workload cluster. The Portworx Backup source is the PX-Store (SDS) configured for the workload cluster. The Portwork Backup target is IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS). Portworx Backup supports encryption of backups in transit. IBM COS supports encryption with Key Management Services. Portworx Backup is setup in management VPC in a management or administration cluster also spread across three availability zones.
-   The OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack is based on the Prometheus, which also can be used to monitor the Portworx cluster
-   Built-in Red Hat OpenShift logging tools are used for Portworx logging.

# 5. Compute Design Considerations

The Multi-zone Resiliency pattern for ROKS includes compute options that are highly available, properly isolated, provide the defined capacity for the applications, and can handle increased workload demands.

Provision VPC Virtual Server Infrastructure (VSI) for the worker nodes as follows:

-   VPC Virtual Server Infrastructure (VSI): select compute and memory profiles, based on capacity and performance requirements. Spread worker nodes hosts evenly across three availability zones (less than 10ms latency required for synchronous replication). 8 cores, 8 GB memory is to be reserved for Portworx, and 10 Gbps bandwidth is recommended.
-   Cluster-Autoscaler: With the cluster-autoscaler add-on, the worker pools in ROKS on IBM Cloud VPC cluster can be scaled automatically to increase or decrease the number of worker nodes in the worker pool based on the sizing needs of the scheduled workloads.
-   Multi-zone deployment: deploy worker nodes across multiple availability zones to protect the application from zone outages. Use a VPC Application Load Balancer (ALB) to front end the services.

# 6. Storage Design Considerations

The Multi-zone Resiliency pattern for ROKS includes highly available storage options on IBM Cloud for the stateful containerized applications.

The following are the IBM Cloud storage recommendations for ROKS for enterprise stateful applications:

-   Use VPC Block storage (10 IOPS) for worker nodes. Create the Block Storage for VPC instances and attach these to each worker node to be added to the Portworx storage layer. For highly availability, Portworx requires at least 3 worker nodes with raw and unformatted block storage (spread the nodes evenly across the AZs).
-   Use Cloud Object Storage to store logs and backups. Cloud Object Storage (COS) is highly available, durable, and secure and provides region and cross-region [resiliency options](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints). Use region COS buckets for logs and cross-region COS buckets for backups.
-   Portworx provides a software defined storage (SDS) solution for a multizone ROKS clusters for stateful apps. Portworx components to be used: PX-Store, STORK and PX-Backup

# 7. Networking Design Considerations

The Multi-zone Resiliency pattern for ROKS leverages IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure and network services to segment the management and application workloads and support the application deployment across multiple availability zones.

-   Deploy the ROKS within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provisioned across multiple availability zones within a region to provide workload isolation within the public cloud.
-   Place each worker node in a separate subnet in each availability zone (less than 10ms latency required for synchronous replication). Use security groups and ACLs as firewalls to limit access to server instances for operational purposes and to control network traffic.
-   Use VPC Application Load Balancers (ALB) to distribute incoming requests to stateful containerized applications.

# 9. Resiliency Design Considerations

The resiliency of applications deployed on Red Hat OpenShift clusters is determined by the availability of the cluster as well as the availability of the application.

**Cluster availability**

The availability of Red Hat OpenShift clusters depends on the availability of the control plane components, namely, the master nodes and etcd database, and the availability of the worker nodes where the applications are deployed.

For workloads deployed on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters, IBM Cloud is responsible for the availability of the clusterâ€™s control plane. When a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster is created, IBM Cloud sets up highly available master nodes and control plane components, automatically backs up etcd data, and provides automated disaster recovery for the control plane. IBM Cloud users are responsible for setting up highly available worker nodes. The following are deployment options for Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters:

**Single-zone clusters**

In single zone clusters, all the worker nodes are provisioned in one availability zone selected by the user. For high availability, at least 3 worker nodes are recommended so that application instances can be distributed across multiple worker nodes to provide protection from worker node failures. Red Hat OpenShift automatically reschedules pods from unavailable worker nodes. In single-zone clusters, IBM Cloud automatically creates three replicas of master components for high availability. If the cluster is created in a multizone region, the three master replicas are spread across the availability zones in the region.

Single-zone clusters provide protection from logical and container failures but do not protect from zone failures or physical host failures since there is no guarantee that the worker nodes will be placed in different physical hosts. Single-zone clusters provide cost-effective solutions with 99.9% infrastructure availability that might be appropriate for non-production environments or non-business critical applications.

**Multi-zone clusters**

In multi-zone clusters, the worker nodes are distributed across availability zones selected by the user. IBM Cloud automatically provisions three replicas of master components spread across availability zones within a region for high availability.

It is recommended to spread the worker nodes evenly across three zones, with 50% capacity provisioned in each zone for a total 150% capacity across all worker nodes. This is a cost-efficient solution that guarantees 100% capacity for the workloads in the event of one zone failure and provides 99.99% infrastructure availability. In contrast, spreading the nodes across two zones would require 100% capacity in each zone for a total capacity of 200% vs 150% and would offer only 99.9% infrastructure availability.

Multi-zone clusters, also known as stretched clusters, provide protection from zone failures and physical host failures. If resources in one zone go down, the workloads can continue to run in worker nodes in the other zones.

Multi-zone clusters are recommended for business-critical applications.

**Application availability**

The availability of a containerized application depends on the availability of the pods where the application is deployed and the applicationâ€™s scalability and ability to handle workload changes. For stateful applications, persistent storage data availability and consistency are also important considerations.

You can use Kubernetes constructs such as deployments, replica sets, and pod anti-affinity to increase the application availability, as follows:

-   Use a [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) to support pod rescheduling, replica sets, and rolling updates.
-   Use [replica sets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-app#replicaset) to define multiple instances of your application. Include enough replicas for your workload plus two.
-   Use [pod anti-affinity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-app#affinity) options to spread the deployment of pods across different worker nodes to protect applications from worker nodes failures. Note that worker nodes in one zone are not guaranteed to be on separate physical compute hosts. To protect against physical compute hosts failure, you must set up a multi-zone cluster which will spread worker nodes across physical hosts in different zones.

Enable [horizontal pod autoscaling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update_app#app_scaling) to automatically increase or decrease the number of instances of the application based on metrics collected from the pods.

Use [cluster autoscaler](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cluster-scaling-classic-vpc&interface=ui) to automatically increase or decrease the number of worker nodes based on workload demands.

For stateful applications, use highly available persistent storage based on the application requirements and deploy applications in a multizone cluster to distribute persistent storage data across multiple availability zones.

In multi-zone clusters, data replication across availability zones can be achieved through application-level replication or storage replication.

Portworx and OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) are Software Defined Storage (SDS) solutions that support data replication and can be deployed on Red Hat OpenShift clusters on IBM Cloud to provide persistent storage for stateful apps. Portworx and ODF replicate data across worker nodes to ensure the stateful app can be rescheduled to a different worker node in case of failure without losing data.

## 9.1 High Availability Design

The Multi-zone Resiliency pattern for ROKS deploys the Red Hat OpenShift cluster architecture across multiple availability zones within a region. The worker nodes are evenly spread across three availability zones. For multizone clusters, Portworx is recommended as SDS for stateful applications. Portworx is a highly available SDS solution that provides persistent storage for the containerized databases and stateful apps and enables sharing of data between pods across multiple zones. Portworx abstracts storage of various types and sizes attached to the worker nodes in the cluster. Worker nodes with attached storage are added as a node to a storage cluster and presented as a virtual storage pool for the stateful applications. The storage cluster is managed by PX-Store, a component of Portworx and it automatically replicates data in the volumes across worker nodes and zones in the cluster so stateful applications can be rescheduled to another worker node in case of a worker node failure or reboot providing high availability across nodes/racks/AZs. PX-Store supports multi-writer shared volumes across multiple containers.

Following are Portworx (High Availability) requirements for enterprise stateful applications:

-   Minimum 3 worker nodes across 3 AZs
-   Minimum of 8 cores & 8 GB RAM are recommended to be reserved for Portworx  
    [Note: These are minimum number of nodes/cores/memory. Depending on the scale of production environment, more nodes and higher cores/memory will be required.]

## 9.2 Backup and Restore Design

Backup and restore solutions for containerized applications must protect both the cluster as well as the application to enable recovery in the event of failures triggered by ransomware attacks, software data corruption, accidental deletions, or any other cause.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters include automatic back-up and recovery of cluster control plane components, namely etcd data. The user is responsible for backing up the application. Application backups must protect application data and metadata included in application-related cluster resources, stateful applicationâ€™s data stored in persistent storage, and internal images.

The Multi-zone Resiliency pattern for ROKS uses Portworx to backup the application.

Portworx Backup provides Kubernetes data protection platform for the persistent data both in transit and at rest. It is app-aware including stateful apps and provides a simple self-service interface for backup and restore. It can operate at Pod, Namespace or Cluster level. Portworx Backup (PX-Backup) is setup in Management VPC in an administration mutizone cluster. The following is Portworx Backup solution at a high level:

-   Backup Source: Portworx Enterprise (PX-Store) â€“ SDS for stateful application
-   Target: IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)
-   Portworx has Backup Automation and Scheduling
-   STORK (STorage Orchestrator Runtime for Kubernetes) provides Kubernetes consistent backup of applications (running in workload cluster) across multi-pod in a namespace. STORK is an agent and should be installed on the application cluster before PX-Backup cluster installation. STORK bridges the gap between Portworx Backup running on your management cluster, and the workload cluster that need to be backed up.
-   Portworx Backup uses MongoDB (runs with 3 replicas for high availability) as the datastore (installed as part of the Portworx Backup deployment) for writing the metadata of backup object data.

# 10. Service Management Design Considerations

To ensure Portworx storage infrastructure's health, performance, and reliability, the Portworx cluster needs to be monitored. For monitoring Portworx, ROKS on IBM Cloud include built-in tools (Prometheus) to manage the health of single cluster instance. For Portworx on Red Hat OpenShift version 4.14 or above, Portworx components need to be configured to work with the OpenShift Prometheus.

For Portworx logging, ROKS on IBM Cloud include built-in tools to manage the health of single cluster instance. Built-in pod logs are not configured with persistent storage and integration with a cloud database is required to back up the logging data and make it highly available.

Note: Portworx upgrades should follow the instructions at <https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-enterprise/operations/operate-kubernetes/upgrade/upgrade-px-ibm.>

## 10.1 Monitoring Design

The OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack is based on the Prometheus. Portworx cluster can be monitored using Prometheus. For Portworx on Red Hat OpenShift version 4.14 or above, Portworx components need to be configured to work with the OpenShift Prometheus deployment for monitoring, since the native Portworx Prometheus support is not available on these OpenShift versions. To configure the Portworx monitoring solution see <https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-enterprise/install-portworx/monitoring/monitor-portworx-cluster>. [Note: Portworx Monitoring data can also be shown in IBM Cloud Monitoring and Portworx Grafana dashboard.]

## 10.2 Logging Design

Built-in Red Hat OpenShift logging tools are used and can be installed using the cluster logging operator. The worker pool should have at least 4 cores and 32 GB memory and 3 worker nodes to run cluster logging stack. To deploy the cluster logging operator and stack on ROKS on IBM Cloud cluster see [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-health\#oc_logging_operator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-health#oc_logging_operator). The cluster logging instance needs an IBM Cloud Block Storage storage class.

## 10.3 Alerting Design

Prometheus Alertmanager handles alerts sent from the Prometheus server based on the set rules, which can be configured. When a rule is triggered, Alertmanager sends a notification to the specified receivers. The receivers are configured using an Alertmanager config file. To configure the Portworx alerting solution see <https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-enterprise/install-portworx/monitoring/monitor-portworx-cluster>.
