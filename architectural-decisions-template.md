# Components
{: #components}

Listing of components and their purpose in the architecture should include what requirement the component meets, what component was chosen for this architecture, the reasons for the choice, and any alternative choices considered. These alternative choices _should_ be components or modules that have been tested to swap out.

If the architecture is large and includes several rows of the heat map, consider grouping each row in the design requirements heat map as an H3 section. Include a  table for just that row where the caption represents that title. For example, `### Security decisions`. Otherwise, use a single table and now subsections.


| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
|             |           |                    |                    |
{: caption="Table 1. Architectural decisions" caption-side="bottom"}
